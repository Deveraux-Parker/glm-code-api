This is a simple GLM Code Plan API to connect your agentic code-tools to. The openai_glm_server exposes a simple openai spec api.

The demo_client is a simple API demonstration client that calls the API and demonstrates streaming/nonstreaming/tool use and the reasoning modes, with some useful tools to see behind the curtain (like API context) so you can understand what it's doing under the hood.

Built to be simple, hackable, and functional.

Add your code plan api to the apikey.json and enjoy.
